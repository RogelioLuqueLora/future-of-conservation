    <h3> The Future of Conservation survey </h3>
    <hr class="primary">
    <p>
      There have long been debates regarding the future direction of biodiversity conservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently these have focused particularly around what has been termed ‘New Conservation’. So far his debate has proven to be highly polarised, especially as it has been driven by a few powerful voices that tend to fit fairly neatly into the either ‘New Conservation’ or ‘Traditional Conservation’ viewpoints.

      This survey aims to provide empirical evidence that the views held by the conservation community are more diverse and nuanced than this debate suggests. We hope to contribute towards making sure that those voices are taken into consideration in debates about the future of conservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The views and values held by particular conservationists are expected to influence their work in a variety of ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a researcher might choose to study how a conservation project impacts upon ecosystem services, rather than biodiversity, if they believe that conservation should primarily be about improving human welfare. Similarly, a practitioner might decide not to partner with corporations if he believes that using capitalism as a conservation tool is risky and ultimately counter-productive.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hope that you find the experience of engaging with this survey, and finding out how your views compare to others, to be informative, and to help you in your work. We encourage you to share your experience, and to encourage others to take part in the survey.

    <h3> What next?  </h3>
    <hr class="primary">
    <p>
      We plan to use the data collected from the demographic questions to establish whether there are any factors (such as nationality, educational background, or experience of different ecosystems) that explain some of the variation in the views held by conservationists.
    </p>
    <p>
      We aim to disseminate our findings amongst the conservation community, through this website, through publications in conservation journals, and other outlets.
